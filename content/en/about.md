Hi, my name is Ruben, and I am a 22-year-old computer science student from Hesse, Germany.
Currently, I am still in the midst of my bachelor's studies, but due to work experience, I have already dealt with many different frameworks. Now, I am stepping into the role of a freelancer and offering my skills to clients who have an idea and want to implement it easily and without much effort on their part.

## Offer

1. App Development -> iOS and Android, depending on the complexity
2. Backend Development
3. Static websites for individuals or businesses
